## Introduction

Cloud optimization can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Our AI-powered product - Optima - discovers unnecessary AWS spending and eliminates it. We free up your engineering team to focus on what matters most: building the product. Optima automates instance rightsizing, reserved instances trading, savings plans managing, and intelligently shutting down unused instances. Optima identifies savings opportunities in real-time and provides easy-to-access actionable notifications directly within Slack (Support for other platforms like Teams and Discord is coming soon). In addition, you will be able to manage inventories and generate visualizations and reports using our web portal.

## Pillars of Optima

### Autopilot

Autopilot trades reserved instances and manages savings plans on your behalf by monitoring and forecasting your usage. Unlike AWS's recommendations, Autopilot actively tracks RI transactions and updates based on the most recent data. Autopilot also takes both savings plans and reserved instances into account when determining the optimal action, a feature not currently available in AWS.

### ClariSpend

ClariSpend provides daily billing, utilization, and savings reports, as well as weekly trend data. The reports are grouped by accounts and services. ClariSpend also detects and highlights irregularities in your AWS usage to help you detect anomalies and react early. Through our comprehensive reporting, you will be able to understand and stay up to date on your AWS usage and how much we are saving for you.

### Saving Bot

Saving Bot helps you shut down and rightsize EC2 instances. Saving bot monitors your EC2 instances and notifies you of under-utilized ones that eat away your cloud costs. Saving bot can be configured to automatically shut down some instances, while only acting after human confirmation on instances that are risky to shut down. Rightsizing adjusts the instance type to match the usage, without affecting or altering the instance's content.

### FAI (Coming soon)

A collection of AI assistants that offer capabilities beyond those of ChatGPT.
